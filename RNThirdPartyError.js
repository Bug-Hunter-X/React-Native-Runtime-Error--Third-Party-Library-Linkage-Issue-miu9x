This error occurs when using a third-party library that has not been properly configured or linked within your React Native project.  It often manifests as a runtime error during the application's execution. A common cause is when a native module dependency isn't correctly integrated into the iOS or Android build process.  This can result in the app crashing or failing to load specific features.
