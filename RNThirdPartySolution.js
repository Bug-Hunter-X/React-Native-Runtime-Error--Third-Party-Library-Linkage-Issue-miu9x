To resolve this, ensure all native dependencies for the library are correctly linked.  For iOS, this usually involves running `pod install` in the iOS folder of your project.  For Android, follow the library's instructions, often involving adding the correct dependencies in the `android/app/build.gradle` file and syncing the project. Verify that the library's documentation was followed precisely and the correct versions of its dependencies are installed.  If the issue persists, check your project's build configurations and ensure that no conflicting versions or dependencies exist.
